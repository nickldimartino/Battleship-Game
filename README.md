# Battleship-Game

This is the game of Battleship! It functions the same way as the traditional game.  Each player must <br /> choose the layout of their fleet of five boats: Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine and <br /> 
Patrol Boat.  Once each player has chosen their layout, the game begins!  Players alternate guesses to <br /> 
find their opponet's boats.  The first player to sink all five of their opponet's ships wins! <br />
