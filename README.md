## Gameplay
This is the game of Battleship! It functions the same way as the traditional game.  Each player must choose the layout of their fleet of five boats: Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine and Patrol Boat.  Once each player has chosen their layout, the game begins!  Players alternate guesses to find their opponet's boats.  The first player to sink all five of their opponet's ships wins! <br /> 

## Reason for Build
This project was completed under the General Assembly - Software Engineer Immersive Project 1 guidelines.  Students had a week to build a game from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  The following data was the time table for my work.
