# Battleship-Game

This is the game of Battleship! It functions the same way as the traditional game.  Each player must choose the layout of their fleet of five boats: Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine and Patrol Boat.  Once each player has chosen their layout, the game begins!  Players alternate guesses to find their opponet's boats.  The first player to sink all five of their opponet's ships wins!

This project was completed under the General Assembly - Software Engineer Immersive Project 1 guidelines.  Students had a week to build a game from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  The following data was the time table for my work.

Thursday, February 22nd: Wireframe and Pseudocode plan - 2 hours
Friday, February 23rd: First draft of HTML and CSS completed - 6 hours
Sunday, February 25th: Turns based-system of game completed - 7 hours
Monday, February 26nd: Quality of life features for turn-based system and code refactoring and comments completed - 9 hours
Tuesday, February 22nd: Updated the UI to be more user friendly, smoothed out turn-based system, and bug fixes* - 7 hours

Bug Fixes:
